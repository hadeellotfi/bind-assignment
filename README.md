# Bind It! (Task in Angular)

1. create three components :
    - Game Control Component
    - Odd Component
    - Even Component 
2. The GameControl should have two buttons : 
    - Start game button
    - End game button 
3. When starting the game an event holding a incrementing number 
   should get emited each Secound (ref = setInterval())
4. The event should be listnable from outside the component.
5. When stop the game no more event should get emited (clearInterval) 
6. A new odd component should get created for every odd number emited, 
   the same should happen for the Even component (on Even number). 
7. Simply output Odd Number or Even Number in the two components. 
8. Style the element (ex. paragraph) holding your output text
    differently in both components.
